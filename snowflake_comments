Setup Options in Snowflake:
1. Snowflake Notebooks (Recommended for simplicity)

Create a new Snowflake Notebook
Copy the SnowflakeCommentMonitor class
Configure your connection and email settings
Use Snowflake's built-in notebook scheduling feature to run daily

2. Snowflake Tasks + Stored Procedures

Create a Python stored procedure with the monitoring logic
Create a Snowflake Task to run the procedure on a schedule
This runs entirely within Snowflake infrastructure

3. External Python Script

Run the script from your local machine or a server
Connect to Snowflake using Snowpark
Use cron/Task Scheduler to run daily

Key Changes from Original:

Uses Snowpark Session instead of SQLAlchemy
Stores tracking state in a Snowflake table instead of JSON file
Leverages Snowflake SQL functions for hash comparison and change detection
Optimized for Snowflake data types and operations

Setup Instructions:

Install required packages:

bash   pip install snowflake-snowpark-python

Update configuration:

Replace connection_parameters with your Snowflake details
Update source_table with your actual table name
Configure email settings


Column mapping:

Update the SQL query in get_current_data() to match your table structure
Ensure you have ID, GENERALCOMMENTS, and timestamp columns


Test first run:

Run manually to ensure everything works
Check that the tracking table is created properly



Scheduling Options:

Snowflake Notebooks: Use the built-in scheduler (easiest)
Snowflake Tasks: For enterprise automation within Snowflake
External scheduling: Cron, Windows Task Scheduler, or cloud functions

Would you like me to help you adapt any specific parts for your table structure or set up the scheduling component?
